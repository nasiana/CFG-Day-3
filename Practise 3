use bakery

-- find all sweet items that start with the letter 'c'
select sw.item_name
from sweet sw
where sw.item_name
like 'c%';

-- find all savoury items that cost more than £1, but less than £3
select sv.item_name, sv.price
from savoury sv
-- this is the way to be mathematically rigorous
where sv.price > 1 and sv.price < 3;
-- using 'BETWEEN 1 AND 3' returns values including 1 and 3
-- can do 'BETWEEN 1.01 AND 2.99', Hassan said we can but i'm a Physicist and this isn't mathematically rigorous
